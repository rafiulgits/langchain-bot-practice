About Me
I am Rafiul Islam. I have completed my graduation on Software Engineering from Shahjalal University of Science and Technology in short SUST.
I did my internship in Cefalo Bangladesh Limited. Then I have joined a startup company named SolseTech Limited. After one and half year working 
there I decided to start my own business. Then along with my other team members we build LogiQbits Limited, our very own software company.
